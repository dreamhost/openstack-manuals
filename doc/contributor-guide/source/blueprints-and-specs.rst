Content specification
=====================

Blueprints and specifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Documentation team uses specifications in the `docs-specs repository
<http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/docs-specs>`_ to maintain large
changes. Approved specifications are published at `Documentation Program
Specifications <http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/docs-specs>`_.
For tracking purposes, a blueprint is created for each specification.

Use blueprints and specifications:

* When adding large sections to an existing document to ensure involvement
  of the docs core team.
* When adding an entirely new deliverable to the docs project.
* For any work that requires both content and tooling changes, such as
  addition of the API reference site.
* For any large reorganization of a deliverable or set of deliverables.
* For automation work that needs to be designed prior to proposing a patch.
* For work that should definitely be discussed at a summit.

A specification needs two +2 votes from the docs-specs-core team.
See the current list of `docs-specs core team
<https://review.openstack.org/#/admin/groups/384,members>`_.
For more information, see `Blueprints and specifications
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Blueprints#Blueprints_and_Specs>`_.

Use bugs against openstack-manuals or openstack-api-site:

* For known content issues, even if you have to do multiple patches to close
  the bug.
* To add content that is just missing.
* For known errors in a document.

For more information, see :ref:`doc_bugs`.

Release-specific documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Installation Guides, Configuration Reference, and Networking Guide
are released at release time, with draft material published to
https://docs.openstack.org/draft/draft-index.html.
The rest of the guides are continuously released.

To patch for the release-specific documentation, you should generally patch to
master branch with "backport: xxxx" (for example, backport: kilo) in the commit
message.

For these guides, the docs.openstack.org site defaults to the current release,
with the previous two releases being available under the ``More Releases
& Languages`` drop-down. At release time, the documentation release team
will update the default page to the new release, and remove the link to
the oldest release. These docs are still available online for people who
have direct URLs to the content, but they are no longer linked from the
main site. For books written in DocBook XML, these old versions are clearly
marked with the release name in red down the left-hand margin. We are
currently developing a similar method of marking older books written in RST.
The core team tracks usage of older versions, and as usage falls, can
remove them entirely.

Installation Guides
-------------------

The OpenStack Installation Guide describes a manual install process for

We are migrating away from WADL in 2016. Refer to :ref:`api-docs` for details.
Once the migration is complete, the API reference pages will be stored in the
project repositories and we will have redirects in place for these API pages.

Project-specific guides
-----------------------

Each project maintains its own developer guide.
They are published from each project repository.
See http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-projects.html
and http://docs.openstack.org/developer/language-bindings.html.

Contributor guides
------------------

Generally, the http://docs.openstack.org/developer/ documentation is meant
for contributors to OpenStack projects. Each project's repo has a
``doc/source`` directory where RST source files are stored. They are built
automatically with Sphinx when the patch is merged. For example, see
http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/horizon/tree/doc/source for the
horizon contributor documentation source and http://docs.openstack.org/developer/horizon/
for the built documentation.

* `Infrastructure User Manual <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual>`_:
  Reference documentation for tools and processes used for all
  contributors to OpenStack projects. It includes instructions on how
  to create all the necessary accounts, setup development environment,
  use gerrit review workflow. The manual also covers more
  advanced topics, like how to create new git repositories. The manual is
  maintained by the OpenStack Infrastructure team.
