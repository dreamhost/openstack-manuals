Building documentation
======================

Building output locally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The openstack-manuals project uses a `tox.ini
<http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/openstack-manuals/tree/tox.ini>`_
file with specific sections that run jobs using the `Tox
<https://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ tool, a virtualenv-based
automation of test activities.

Tox prerequisites and installation
----------------------------------

**Install the prerequisites for Tox:**

* On Ubuntu or Debian:

  .. code-block:: console

     # apt-get install gcc gettext python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev \
       zlib1g-dev

  You may need to use :command:`pip install` for some packages.

* On RHEL or CentOS including Fedora:

  .. code-block:: console

     # yum install gcc python-devel libxml2-devel libxslt-devel

* On openSUSE or SUSE Linux Enterprise:

  .. code-block:: console

     # zypper install gcc python-devel libxml2-devel libxslt-devel

**Install python-tox:**

.. code-block:: console

   # pip install tox

Build workflow
--------------

Once Tox is installed and configured, execute :command:`tox -e <jobname>`
to run a particular job:

* To build all docs, open your local openstack-manuals project and run:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ tox -e checkbuild

* To build a specific guide, add the guide folder name to the
  :command:`tox -e build` command. For example:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ tox -e build -- contributor-guide


  .. note::

     This command does not work for the install-guide, as it
     contains conditional content. To build specific parts of the
     Installation tutorials, use the commands below:

     .. code-block:: console

        $ tox -e install-guide-debconf
        $ tox -e install-guide-debian
        $ tox -e install-guide-obs
        $ tox -e install-guide-rdo
        $ tox -e install-guide-ubuntu

This runs the :command:`sphinx-build` command. When the build is finished,
it displays in the ``openstack-manuals/publish-docs`` directory.
You can open the ``.html`` file in a browser to view the resulting output.

If you do not want to use Tox, install the below prerequisites locally:

.. code-block:: console

   # pip install sphinx
   # pip install openstackdocstheme

To get the ``.html`` output locally, switch to the directory containing a
``conf.py`` and run:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sphinx-build /path/to/source/ path/to/build/

The RST source is built into HTML using Sphinx, so that it is displayed on
the *docs.openstack.org/<guide-name>*. For example:
http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/.

Using Tox to check builds
-------------------------

As a part of the review process, Jenkins runs gating scripts to check that
the patch is fine. Locally, you can use the Tox tool to ensure that a patch
works. To check all books, run the following command from the base directory
of repository:

.. code-block:: console

   $ tox

The following individual checks are also availableÀê

* :command:`tox -e checkniceness` - to run the niceness tests (for example,
  to see extra whitespaces)
* :command:`tox -e checksyntax` - to run syntax checks
* :command:`tox -e checklang` - to check all the translated manuals
* :command:`tox -e docs` - to build only RST-sourced manuals
* :command:`tox -e checkbuild` - to build all the manuals. This will also
  generate a directory ``publish-docs`` that contains the built files for
  inspection.

.. note::

   * The scripts are not written for Windows, but we encourage
     cross-platform work on our scripts.
   * If Tox stops working, try :command:`tox --recreate` to rebuild the
     environment.

.. _docs_builds_locally:

Build an existing patch locally
-------------------------------

To build a patch locally:

#. Change to the directory containing the appropriate repository:

   * openstack-manuals
   * security-doc
   * api-site

   For example:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ cd openstack-manuals

#. Create a local branch that contains the particular patch.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git review -d PATCH_ID

   Where the value of ``PATCH_ID`` is a Gerrit commit number.
   You can find this number on the patch link,
   ``https://review.openstack.org/#/c/PATCH_ID``.

#. Build all the books that are affected by changes in the patch set:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ tox -e checkbuild

#. Find the build result in ``publish-docs/index.html``.

Build jobs
~~~~~~~~~~

The build jobs for documentation are stored in the
http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/project-config
repository. The :file:`zuul/layout.yaml` file and the
``jenkins/jobs/manual-jobs.yaml`` or ``jenkins/jobs/api-jobs.yaml``
file contain the Jenkins build jobs that build to the docs.openstack.org
and developer.openstack.org sites, copying built files via FTP.

The release specific books are built for the currently supported branches
(current and previous releases), development happens on the master branch.
The continuously released books are only built on the master branch.

Like other projects, the documentation projects use a number of jobs
that do automatic testing of patches.

The current jobs are:

* gate-openstack-manuals-tox-checkniceness
* gate-openstack-manuals-tox-doc-publish-checkbuild
* gate-openstack-manuals-tox-checklang

Checklang job
-------------

We only gate on manual/language combinations that are translated
sufficiently. For example, in openstack-manuals this includes Japanese with
the Security Guide, HA Guide and Install Guides.

* If an import from Zanata fails, we do not approve the import.
* If any other patch fails, the failure might get ignored.
* In any case of failure, a bug gets reported against the `i18n project
  <https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-i18n>`_.

If you want to manually run this check on your local workstation you can use
the checklang environment (:command:`tox -e checklang`). To use this
environment, you first have to install the *xml2po* utility on your local
workstation. xml2po is part of the gnome-doc-utils and can be installed with
:command:`yum install gnome-doc-utils` (on RedHat-based distributions), or
:command:`zypper install xml2po` (on SUSE-based distributions).
