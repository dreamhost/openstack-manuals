Security requirements
=====================

When deploying OpenStack in an enterprise as a private cloud, it is
usually behind the firewall and within the trusted network alongside
existing systems. Users are employees that are bound by the
company security requirements. This tends to drive most of the security
domains towards a more trusted model. However, when deploying OpenStack
in a public facing role, no assumptions can be made and the attack vectors
significantly increase.

Consider the following security implications and requirements:

* Managing the users for both public and private clouds. The Identity service
  allows for LDAP to be part of the authentication process. This may ease user
  management if integrating into existing systems.

* User authentication requests include sensitive information including
  usernames, passwords, and authentication tokens. It is strongly recommended
  to place API services behind hardware that performs SSL termination.

* Negative or hostile users who would attack or compromise the security
  of your deployment regardless of firewalls or security agreements.

* Attack vectors increase further in a public facing OpenStack deployment.
  For example, the API endpoints and the software behind it become
  vulnerable to hostile entities attempting to gain unauthorized access
  or prevent access to services. You should provide appropriate filtering and
  periodic security auditing.

.. warning::

   Be mindful of consistency when utilizing third party
   clouds to explore authentication options.

Security domains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A security domain comprises of users, applications, servers or networks
that share common trust requirements and expectations within a system.
Typically they have the same authentication and authorization
requirements and users.

Security domains include:

Public security domains
 The public security domain can refer to the internet as a whole or
 networks over which you have no authority. This domain is considered
 untrusted. For example, in a hybrid cloud deployment, any information
 traversing between and beyond the clouds is in the public domain and
 untrustworthy.

Guest security domains
 The guest security domain handles compute data generated by instances
 on the cloud, but not services that support the operation of the
 cloud, such as API calls. Public cloud providers and private cloud
 providers who do not have stringent controls on instance use or who
 allow unrestricted internet access to instances should consider this
 domain to be untrusted. Private cloud providers may want to consider
 this network as internal and therefore trusted only if they have
 controls in place to assert that they trust instances and all their
 tenants.

Management security domains
 The management security domain is where services interact. Sometimes
 referred to as the control plane, the networks in this domain
 transport confidential data such as configuration parameters, user
 names, and passwords. In most deployments this domain is considered
 trusted when it is behind an organization's firewall.

Data security domains
 The data security domain is primarily concerned with information
 pertaining to the storage services within OpenStack. The data
 that crosses this network has high integrity and confidentiality
 requirements and, depending on the type of deployment, may also have
 strong availability requirements. The trust level of this network is
 heavily dependent on other deployment decisions.

These security domains can be individually or collectively mapped to an
OpenStack deployment. The cloud operator should be aware of the appropriate
security concerns. Security domains should be mapped out against your specific
OpenStack deployment topology. The domains and their trust requirements depend
upon whether the cloud instance is public, private, or hybrid.

Hypervisor security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The hypervisor also requires a security assessment. In a
public cloud, organizations typically do not have control
over the choice of hypervisor. Properly securing your
hypervisor is important. Attacks made upon the
unsecured hypervisor are called a **hypervisor breakout**.
Hypervisor breakout describes the event of a
compromised or malicious instance breaking out of the resource
controls of the hypervisor and gaining access to the bare
metal operating system and hardware resources.

Hypervisor security is not an issue if the security of instances is not
important. However, enterprises can minimize vulnerability by avoiding
hardware sharing with others in a public cloud.

Baremetal security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are other services worth considering that provide a
bare metal instance instead of a cloud. In other cases, it is
possible to replicate a second private cloud by integrating
with a private Cloud-as-a-Service deployment. The
organization does not buy the hardware, but also does not share
with other tenants. It is also possible to use a provider that
hosts a bare-metal public cloud instance for which the
hardware is dedicated only to one customer, or a provider that
offers private Cloud-as-a-Service.

.. important::

   Each cloud implements services differently. Understand the security
   requirements of every cloud that handles the organization's data or
   workloads.

Networking security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider security implications and requirements before designing the
physical and logical network topologies. Make sure that the networks are
properly segregated and traffic flows are going to the correct
destinations without crossing through locations that are undesirable.
Consider the following factors:

* Firewalls
* Overlay interconnects for joining separated tenant networks
* Routing through or avoiding specific networks

How networks attach to hypervisors can expose security
vulnerabilities. To mitigate hypervisor breakouts, separate networks
from other systems and schedule instances for the
network onto dedicated Compute nodes. This prevents attackers
from having access to the networks from a compromised instance.

Multi-site security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Securing a multi-site OpenStack installation brings
several challenges. Tenants may expect a tenant-created network
to be secure. In a multi-site installation the use of a
non-private connection between sites may be required. This may
mean that traffic would be visible to third parties and, in
cases where an application requires security, this issue
requires mitigation. In these instances, install a VPN or
encrypted connection between sites to conceal sensitive traffic.

Identity is another security consideration. Authentication
centralization provides a single authentication point for
users across the deployment, and a single administration point
for traditional create, read, update, and delete operations.
Centralized authentication is also useful for auditing purposes because
all authentication tokens originate from the same source.

Tenants in multi-site installations need isolation
from each other. The main challenge is ensuring tenant networks
function across regions which is not currently supported in OpenStack
Networking (neutron). Therefore an external system may be required
to manage mapping. Tenant networks may contain sensitive information requiring
accurate and consistent mapping to ensure that a tenant in one site
does not connect to a different tenant in another site.
