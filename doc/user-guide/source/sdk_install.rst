How to install the  OpenStack SDK
---------------------------------

Each OpenStack project has its own Python library. These libraries are
bundled with the command-line clients. For example, the Python bindings
for the Compute API are bundled with the python-novaclient package.

For details about how to install the clients, see
:doc:`../common/cli_install_openstack_command_line_clients`.
