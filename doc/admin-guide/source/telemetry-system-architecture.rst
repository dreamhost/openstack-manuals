.. _telemetry-system-architecture:

===================
System architecture
===================

The Telemetry service uses an agent-based architecture. Several modules
combine their responsibilities to collect data, store samples in a
database, or provide an API service for handling incoming requests.

The Telemetry service is built from the following agents and services:

ceilometer-api
    Presents aggregated metering data to consumers (such as billing
    engines and analytics tools).

ceilometer-polling
    Polls for different kinds of meter data by using the polling
    plug-ins (pollsters) registered in different namespaces. It provides a
    single polling interface across different namespaces.

ceilometer-agent-central
    Polls the public RESTful APIs of other OpenStack services such as
    Compute service and Image service, in order to keep tabs on resource
    existence, by using the polling plug-ins (pollsters) registered in
    the central polling namespace.

ceilometer-agent-compute
    Polls the local hypervisor or libvirt daemon to acquire performance
    data for the local instances, messages and emits the data as AMQP
    messages, by using the polling plug-ins (pollsters) registered in
    the compute polling namespace.

ceilometer-agent-ipmi
    Polls the local node with IPMI support, in order to acquire IPMI
    sensor data and Intel Node Manager data, by using the polling
    plug-ins (pollsters) registered in the IPMI polling namespace.

ceilometer-agent-notification
    Consumes AMQP messages from other OpenStack services.

ceilometer-collector
    Consumes AMQP notifications from the agents, then dispatches these
    data to the appropriate data store.

ceilometer-alarm-evaluator
    Determines when alarms fire due to the associated statistic trend
    crossing a threshold over a sliding time window.

ceilometer-alarm-notifier
    Initiates alarm actions, for example calling out to a webhook with a
    description of the alarm state transition.

    .. note::

       The ``ceilometer-polling`` service is available since the Kilo release.
       It is intended to replace ``ceilometer-agent-central``,
       ``ceilometer-agent-compute``, and ``ceilometer-agent-ipmi``.

Besides the ``ceilometer-agent-compute`` and the ``ceilometer-agent-ipmi``
services, all the other services are placed on one or more controller
nodes.

The Telemetry architecture highly depends on the AMQP service both for
consuming notifications coming from OpenStack services and internal
communication.


.. _telemetry-supported-databases:

Supported databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The other key external component of Telemetry is the database, where
events, samples, alarm definitions, and alarms are stored.

.. note::

   Multiple database back ends can be configured in order to store
   events, samples, and alarms separately.

The list of supported database back ends:

-  `ElasticSearch (events only) <https://www.elastic.co/>`__

-  `MongoDB <https://www.mongodb.org/>`__

-  `MySQL <http://www.mysql.com/>`__

-  `PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org/>`__

-  `HBase <http://hbase.apache.org/>`__


.. _telemetry-supported-hypervisors:

Supported hypervisors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Telemetry service collects information about the virtual machines,
which requires close connection to the hypervisor that runs on the
compute hosts.

The following is a list of supported hypervisors.

-  The following hypervisors are supported via `libvirt <http://libvirt.org/>`__

   *  `Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) <http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page>`__

   *  `Quick Emulator (QEMU) <http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page>`__

   *  `Linux Containers (LXC) <https://linuxcontainers.org/>`__

   *  `User-mode Linux (UML) <http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/>`__

   .. note::

      For details about hypervisor support in libvirt please check the
      `Libvirt API support matrix <http://libvirt.org/hvsupport.html>`__.

-  `Hyper-V <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/hyper-v-server/default.aspx>`__

-  `XEN <http://www.xenproject.org/help/documentation.html>`__

-  `VMware vSphere <http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere-hypervisor/support.html>`__


Supported networking services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Telemetry is able to retrieve information from OpenStack Networking and
external networking services:

-  OpenStack Networking:

   -  Basic network meters

   -  Firewall-as-a-Service (FWaaS) meters

   -  Load-Balancer-as-a-Service (LBaaS) meters

   -  VPN-as-a-Service (VPNaaS) meters

-  SDN controller meters:

   -  `OpenDaylight <https://www.opendaylight.org/>`__

   -  `OpenContrail <http://www.opencontrail.org/>`__


.. _telemetry-users-roles-tenants:

Users, roles, and tenants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This service of OpenStack uses OpenStack Identity for authenticating and
authorizing users. The required configuration options are listed in the
`Telemetry
section <http://docs.openstack.org/mitaka/config-reference/telemetry.html>`__
in the OpenStack Configuration Reference.

The system uses two roles:``admin`` and ``non-admin``. The authorization
happens before processing each API request. The amount of returned data
depends on the role the requestor owns.

The creation of alarm definitions also highly depends on the role of the
user, who initiated the action. Further details about :ref:`telemetry-alarms`
handling can be found in this guide.
