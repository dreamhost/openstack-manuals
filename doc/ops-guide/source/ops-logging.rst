Where Are the Logs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most services use the convention of writing their log files to
subdirectories of the ``/var/log directory``, as listed in
:ref:`table_log_locations`.

Reading the Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenStack services use the standard logging levels, at increasing
severity: DEBUG, INFO, AUDIT, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL, and TRACE. That
is, messages only appear in the logs if they are more "severe" than the
particular log level, with DEBUG allowing all log statements through.
For example, TRACE is logged only if the software has a stack trace,
while INFO is logged for every message including those that are only for
information.

To disable DEBUG-level logging, edit ``/etc/nova/nova.conf`` file as follows:

.. code-block:: ini

   debug=false

Keystone is handled a little differently. To modify the logging level,
edit the ``/etc/keystone/logging.conf`` file and look at the
``logger_root`` and ``handler_file`` sections.

Logging for horizon is configured in
``/etc/openstack_dashboard/local_settings.py``. Because horizon is
a Django web application, it follows the `Django Logging framework
conventions <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/logging/>`_.

The first step in finding the source of an error is typically to search
for a CRITICAL, TRACE, or ERROR message in the log starting at the
bottom of the log file.

Here is an example of a CRITICAL log message, with the corresponding
TRACE (Python traceback) immediately following:

.. code-block:: console

   2013-02-25 21:05:51 17409 CRITICAL cinder [-] Bad or unexpected response from the storage volume backend API:
   volume group cinder-volumes doesn't exist

    backend API: volume group cinder-volumes doesn't exist
   2013-02-25 21:05:51 17409 TRACE cinder

In this example, ``cinder-volumes`` failed to start and has provided a
stack trace, since its volume back end has been unable to set up the
storage volumeâ€”probably because the LVM volume that is expected from the
configuration does not exist.

Here is an example error log:

.. code-block:: console

   2013-02-25 20:26:33 6619 ERROR nova.openstack.common.rpc.common [-] AMQP server on localhost:5672 is unreachable:
    [Errno 111] ECONNREFUSED. Trying again in 23 seconds.

In this error, a nova service has failed to connect to the RabbitMQ
server because it got a connection refused error.

Tracing Instance Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an instance fails to behave properly, you will often have to trace
activity associated with that instance across the log files of various
``nova-*`` services and across both the cloud controller and compute
nodes.

The typical way is to trace the UUID associated with an instance across
the service logs.

Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: console

   $ nova list
   +--------------------------------+--------+--------+--------------------------+
   | ID                             | Name   | Status | Networks                 |
   +--------------------------------+--------+--------+--------------------------+
   | fafed8-4a46-413b-b113-f1959ffe | cirros | ACTIVE | novanetwork=192.168.100.3|
   +--------------------------------------+--------+--------+--------------------+

Here, the ID associated with the instance is
``faf7ded8-4a46-413b-b113-f19590746ffe``. If you search for this string
on the cloud controller in the ``/var/log/nova-*.log`` files, it appears
in ``nova-api.log`` and ``nova-scheduler.log``. If you search for this
on the compute nodes in ``/var/log/nova-*.log``, it appears in
``nova-network.log`` and ``nova-compute.log``. If no ERROR or CRITICAL
messages appear, the most recent log entry that reports this may provide
a hint about what has gone wrong.

Adding Custom Logging Statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there is not enough information in the existing logs, you may need to
add your own custom logging statements to the ``nova-*``
services.

The source files are located in
``/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nova``.

To add logging statements, the following line should be near the top of
the file. For most files, these should already be there:

.. code-block:: python

   from nova.openstack.common import log as logging
   LOG = logging.getLogger(__name__)

To add a DEBUG logging statement, you would do:

.. code-block:: python

   LOG.debug("This is a custom debugging statement")

You may notice that all the existing logging messages are preceded by an
underscore and surrounded by parentheses, for example:

.. code-block:: python

   LOG.debug(_("Logging statement appears here"))

This formatting is used to support translation of logging messages into
different languages using the
`gettext <https://docs.python.org/2/library/gettext.html>`_
internationalization library. You don't need to do this for your own
custom log messages. However, if you want to contribute the code back to
the OpenStack project that includes logging statements, you must
surround your log messages with underscores and parentheses.

RabbitMQ Web Management Interface or rabbitmqctl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Aside from connection failures, RabbitMQ log files are generally not
useful for debugging OpenStack related issues. Instead, we recommend you
use the RabbitMQ web management interface. Enable it on your cloud
controller:

.. code-block:: console

   # /usr/lib/rabbitmq/bin/rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management

.. code-block:: console

   # service rabbitmq-server restart

The RabbitMQ web management interface is accessible on your cloud
controller at *http://localhost:55672*.

.. note::

   Ubuntu 12.04 installs RabbitMQ version 2.7.1, which uses port 55672.
   RabbitMQ versions 3.0 and above use port 15672 instead. You can
   check which version of RabbitMQ you have running on your local
   Ubuntu machine by doing:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ dpkg -s rabbitmq-server | grep "Version:"
      Version: 2.7.1-0ubuntu4

An alternative to enabling the RabbitMQ web management interface is to
use the ``rabbitmqctl`` commands. For example,
:command:`rabbitmqctl list_queues| grep cinder` displays any messages left in
the queue. If there are messages, it's a possible sign that cinder
services didn't connect properly to rabbitmq and might have to be
restarted.

Items to monitor for RabbitMQ include the number of items in each of the
queues and the processing time statistics for the server.

Centrally Managing Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because your cloud is most likely composed of many servers, you must
check logs on each of those servers to properly piece an event together.
A better solution is to send the logs of all servers to a central
location so that they can all be accessed from the same
area.

The choice of central logging engine will be dependent on the operating
system in use as well as any organizational requirements for logging tools.

Syslog choices
--------------

There are a large number of syslogs engines available, each have differing
capabilities and configuration requirements.
