HPE 3PAR driver
===============

The HPE 3PAR driver provides NFS and CIFS shared file systems to
OpenStack using HPE 3PAR's File Persona capabilities.

Supported shared filesystems and operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver supports CIFS and NFS shares.

The following operations are supported:

- Create a share.

- Delete a share.

- Allow share access.

  Note the following limitations for NFS shares:

  - IP access rules are required for NFS.

  - Shares created from snapshots are always read-only.

  - Shares not created from snapshots are read-write and subject to
    ACLs.

  Note the following limitations for CIFS shares:

  - SMB shares require user access rules.

  - User access requires a 3PAR local user, since LDAP and AD is not yet
    supported.

  - Shares created from snapshots are always read-only.

  - Shares not created from snapshots are read-write (and subject to
    ACLs).

- Deny share access.

- Create a snapshot.

- Delete a snapshot.

- Create a share from a snapshot.

  Note the following limitations for shares:

  - Shares created from snapshots are always read-only.

- Extend a share.

- Shrink a share.

Share networks are not supported. Shares are created directly on the
3PAR without the use of a share server or service VM. Network
connectivity is setup outside of the Shared File Systems service.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the system running the manila-share service:

-  python-3parclient version 4.2.0 or newer from PyPI.

On the HPE 3PAR array:

-  HPE 3PAR Operating System software version 3.2.1 MU3 or higher.

-  A license that enables the File Persona feature.

-  The array class and hardware configuration must support File.

Pre-configuration on the HPE 3PAR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  HPE 3PAR File Persona must be initialized and started (startfs).

-  A File Provisioning Group (FPG) must be created for use with the
   Shared File Systems service.

-  A Virtual File Server (VFS) must be created for the FPG.

-  The VFS must be configured with an appropriate share export IP
   address.

-  A local user in the Administrators group is needed for CIFS shares.

Back end configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following parameters need to be configured in the Shared File
Systems service configuration file for the HPE 3PAR driver:

.. code-block:: ini

   share_driver = manila.share.drivers.hpe.hpe_3par_driver.HPE3ParShareDriver
   driver_handles_share_servers = False
   hpe3par_share_ip_address = IP_address

The option ``hpe3par_share_ip_address`` must be a valid IP address for
the configured FPG's VFS. This IP address is used in export locations
for shares that are created. Networking must be configured to allow
connectivity from clients to shares.


Network approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connectivity between the storage array (SSH/CLI and WSAPI) and the
Shared File Systems service host is required for share management.

Connectivity between the clients and the VFS is required for mounting
and using the shares. This includes:

-  Routing from the client to the external network.

-  Assigning the client an external IP address, for example a floating IP.

-  Configuring the Shared File Systems service host networking properly
   for IP forwarding.

-  Configuring the VFS networking properly for client subnets.

Share types
~~~~~~~~~~~

When creating a share, a share type can be specified to determine
where and how the share will be created. If a share type is not
specified, the value from the option ``default_share_type`` set in the
Shared File Systems service configuration file is used.

The Shared File Systems service requires that the share type includes
the ``driver_handles_share_servers`` extra-spec. This ensures that the
share will be created on a back end that supports the requested
``driver_handles_share_servers`` (share networks) capability. For the
HPE 3PAR driver, this must be set to ``False``.

Another common Shared File Systems service extra-spec used to determine
where a share is created is ``share_backend_name``. When this extra-spec
is defined in the share type, the share will be created on a back end
with a matching ``share_backend_name``.

The HPE 3PAR driver automatically reports capabilities based on the FPG
used for each back end. Share types with extra specs can be created by
an administrator to control which share types are allowed to use FPGs
with or without specific capabilities. The following extra-specs are
used with the capabilities filter and the HPE 3PAR driver:

``hpe3par_flash_cache``
  This is ``True`` for back ends that have 3PAR's
  Adaptive Flash Cache enabled.

``thin_provisioning``
  This is ``True`` for back ends that use thin provisioned volumes.
  For FPGs that use fully provisioned volumes this is ``False``.
  Back ends that use thin provisioning also support the Shared File
  Systems service's over-subscription feature.

``dedupe``
  This is ``True`` for back ends that use deduplication technology.

Each can either be ``<is> True`` or ``<is> False``.

Scoped extra-specs are used to influence vendor-specific implementation
details. Scoped extra-specs use a prefix followed by a colon. For HPE
3PAR these extra-specs have a prefix of ``hpe3par``.

The following HPE 3PAR extra-specs are used when creating CIFS (SMB)
shares:

``hpe3par:smb_access_based_enum``
  Valid values are ``true`` or ``false``.

  This handles access-based enumeration and specifies if users
  can see only the files and directories to which they have been allowed
  access on the shares. The default is ``false``.

``hpe3par:smb_continuous_avail``
  Valid values are ``true`` or ``false``.

  This handles continuous availability and specifies if SMB3
  continuous availability features should be enabled for this share.
  If not specified, the default is ``true``.

``hpe3par:smb_cache``
  This specifies client-side caching for offline files. Valid values
  are:

  ``off``
    The client must not cache any files from this share. The share is
    configured to disallow caching.

  ``manual``
    The client must allow only manual caching for the files open from
    this share. This is the default.

  ``optimized``
    The client may cache every file that it opens from this share.
    Also, the client may satisfy the file requests from its local
    cache. The share is configured to allow automatic caching of
    programs and documents.

  ``auto``
    The client may cache every file that it opens from this share. The
    share is configured to allow automatic caching of documents.

The following HPE 3PAR extra-specs are used when creating NFS shares:

``hpe3par:nfs_options``
  This is a comma-separated list of NFS export options.

  The NFS export options have the following limitations:

  -  ``ro`` and ``rw`` are not allowed because the value will be determined
     by the driver.

  - ``no_subtree_check`` and ``fsid`` are not allowed per HPE 3PAR CLI
    support.

  -  ``secure``, ``insecure``, ``root_squash``, and ``no_root_squash``
     are not allowed because the HPE 3PAR driver controls those
     settings.

  All other NFS options are forwarded to the HPE 3PAR as part of share
  creation. The HPE 3PAR will do additional validation at share
  creation time. Refer to the HPE 3PAR CLI help for more details.

Driver options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table contains the configuration options specific to the
share driver.

.. include:: ../../tables/manila-hpe3par.rst

Set up the HPE 3PAR environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Install the ``python-3parclient`` python package on the OpenStack Block
   Storage system.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ pip install 'python-3parclient>=4.0,<5.0'


#. Verify that the HPE 3PAR web services API server is enabled and running on
   the HPE 3PAR storage system.

   a. Log in to the HPE 3PAR storage system as an administrator.

      .. code-block:: console

         $ ssh 3paradm@<HPE 3PAR IP Address>

   b. View the current state of the Web Services API Server.

      .. code-block:: console

         $ showwsapi
         -Service- -State- -HTTP_State- HTTP_Port -HTTPS_State- HTTPS_Port -Version-
         Enabled   Active Enabled       8008        Enabled       8080       1.1

   c. If the web services API Server is disabled, start it.

      .. code-block:: console

         $ startwsapi

#. If the HTTP or HTTPS state is disabled, enable one of them.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ setwsapi -http enable

   or, for HTTPS

   .. code-block:: console

      $ setwsapi -https enable

   .. note::

      To stop the Web Services API Server, use the :command:`stopwsapi` command. For
      other options, run the :command:`setwsapi â€“h` command.

Delete nested shares
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a nested share is deleted (nested shares will be created when
``hpe_3par_fstore_per_share`` is set to ``False``), the file tree also
attempts to be deleted.

With NFS shares, there is no additional configuration that needs to be done.

For CIFS shares, ``hpe3par_cifs_admin_access_username`` and
``hpe3par_cifs_admin_access_password`` must be provided. If they are omitted,
the original functionality is honored and the file tree remains untouched.
``hpe3par_cifs_admin_access_domain`` and ``hpe3par_share_mount_path`` can also
be specified to create further customization. For more information on these
configuration values, see :ref:`manila_hpe_driver_option`.
