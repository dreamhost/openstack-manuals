Cross-origin resource sharing
=============================

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows code running in
a browser (JavaScript for example) to make requests to a domain, other than the
one it was originated from. OpenStack services support CORS requests.

For more information, see `Cross-project features
<http://docs.openstack.org/admin-guide/cross-project.html>`__
in OpenStack Administrator Guide.
