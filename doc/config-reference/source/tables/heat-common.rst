.. list-table:: Description of common configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[DEFAULT]**
     -
   * - ``client_retry_limit`` = ``2``
     - (Integer) Number of times to retry when a client encounters an expected intermittent error. Set to 0 to disable retries.
   * - ``convergence_engine`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Enables engine with convergence architecture. All stacks with this option will be created using convergence engine.
   * - ``default_deployment_signal_transport`` = ``CFN_SIGNAL``
     - (String) Template default for how the server should signal to heat with the deployment output values. CFN_SIGNAL will allow an HTTP POST to a CFN keypair signed URL (requires enabled heat-api-cfn). TEMP_URL_SIGNAL will create a Swift TempURL to be signaled via HTTP PUT (requires object-store endpoint which supports TempURL). HEAT_SIGNAL will allow calls to the Heat API resource-signal using the provided keystone credentials. ZAQAR_SIGNAL will create a dedicated zaqar queue to be signaled using the provided keystone credentials.
   * - ``default_software_config_transport`` = ``POLL_SERVER_CFN``
     - (String) Template default for how the server should receive the metadata required for software configuration. POLL_SERVER_CFN will allow calls to the cfn API action DescribeStackResource authenticated with the provided keypair (requires enabled heat-api-cfn). POLL_SERVER_HEAT will allow calls to the Heat API resource-show using the provided keystone credentials (requires keystone v3 API, and configured stack_user_* config options). POLL_TEMP_URL will create and populate a Swift TempURL with metadata for polling (requires object-store endpoint which supports TempURL).ZAQAR_MESSAGE will create a dedicated zaqar queue and post the metadata for polling.
   * - ``deferred_auth_method`` = ``trusts``
     - (String) Select deferred auth method, stored password or trusts.
   * - ``environment_dir`` = ``/etc/heat/environment.d``
     - (String) The directory to search for environment files.
   * - ``error_wait_time`` = ``240``
     - (Integer) Error wait time in seconds for stack action (ie. create or update).
   * - ``event_purge_batch_size`` = ``10``
     - (Integer) Controls how many events will be pruned whenever a stack's events exceed max_events_per_stack. Set this lower to keep more events at the expense of more frequent purges.
   * - ``executor_thread_pool_size`` = ``64``
     - (Integer) Size of executor thread pool.
   * - ``host`` = ``localhost``
     - (String) Name of the engine node. This can be an opaque identifier. It is not necessarily a hostname, FQDN, or IP address.
   * - ``keystone_backend`` = ``heat.common.heat_keystoneclient.KeystoneClientV3``
     - (String) Fully qualified class name to use as a keystone backend.
   * - ``max_interface_check_attempts`` = ``10``
     - (Integer) Number of times to check whether an interface has been attached or detached.
   * - ``memcached_servers`` = ``None``
     - (List) Memcached servers or None for in process cache.
   * - ``periodic_interval`` = ``60``
     - (Integer) Seconds between running periodic tasks.
   * - ``plugin_dirs`` = ``/usr/lib64/heat, /usr/lib/heat, /usr/local/lib/heat, /usr/local/lib64/heat``
     - (List) List of directories to search for plug-ins.
   * - ``reauthentication_auth_method`` =
     - (String) Allow reauthentication on token expiry, such that long-running tasks may complete. Note this defeats the expiry of any provided user tokens.
   * - **[constraint_validation_cache]**
     -
   * - ``caching`` = ``True``
     - (Boolean) Toggle to enable/disable caching when Orchestration Engine validates property constraints of stack.During property validation with constraints Orchestration Engine caches requests to other OpenStack services. Please note that the global toggle for oslo.cache(enabled=True in [cache] group) must be enabled to use this feature.
   * - ``expiration_time`` = ``60``
     - (Integer) TTL, in seconds, for any cached item in the dogpile.cache region used for caching of validation constraints.
   * - **[resource_finder_cache]**
     -
   * - ``caching`` = ``True``
     - (Boolean) Toggle to enable/disable caching when Orchestration Engine looks for other OpenStack service resources using name or id. Please note that the global toggle for oslo.cache(enabled=True in [cache] group) must be enabled to use this feature.
   * - ``expiration_time`` = ``3600``
     - (Integer) TTL, in seconds, for any cached item in the dogpile.cache region used for caching of OpenStack service finder functions.
   * - **[revision]**
     -
   * - ``heat_revision`` = ``unknown``
     - (String) Heat build revision. If you would prefer to manage your build revision separately, you can move this section to a different file and add it as another config option.
   * - **[service_extension_cache]**
     -
   * - ``caching`` = ``True``
     - (Boolean) Toggle to enable/disable caching when Orchestration Engine retrieves extensions from other OpenStack services. Please note that the global toggle for oslo.cache(enabled=True in [cache] group) must be enabled to use this feature.
   * - ``expiration_time`` = ``3600``
     - (Integer) TTL, in seconds, for any cached item in the dogpile.cache region used for caching of service extensions.
