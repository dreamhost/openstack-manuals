.. list-table:: Description of configuration options for ``[object-expirer]`` in ``object-expirer.conf``
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - ``auto_create_account_prefix`` = ``.``
     - Prefix to use when automatically creating accounts
   * - ``concurrency`` = ``1``
     - Number of replication workers to spawn
   * - ``expiring_objects_account_name`` = ``expiring_objects``
     - Account name for expiring objects.
   * - ``interval`` = ``300``
     - Minimum time for a pass to take
   * - ``process`` = ``0``
     - (it will actually accept(2) N + 1). Setting this to one (1) will only handle one request at a time, without accepting another request concurrently.
   * - ``processes`` = ``0``
     - for each port (disk) in the ring. If you have 24 disks per server, and this setting is 4, then each storage node will have 1 + (24 * 4) = 97 total object-server processes running. This gives complete I/O isolation, drastically reducing the impact of slow disks on storage node performance. The object-replicator and object-reconstructor need to see this setting too, so it must be in the [DEFAULT] section.
   * - ``reclaim_age`` = ``604800``
     - Time elapsed in seconds before an object can be reclaimed
   * - ``recon_cache_path`` = ``/var/cache/swift``
     - Directory where stats for a few items will be stored
   * - ``report_interval`` = ``300``
     - Interval in seconds between reports.
