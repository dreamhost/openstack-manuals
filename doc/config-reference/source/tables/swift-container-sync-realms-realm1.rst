.. list-table:: Description of configuration options for ``[realm1]`` in ``container-sync-realms.conf``
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - ``cluster_clustername1`` = ``https://host1/v1/``
     - Any values in the realm section whose names begin with cluster\_ will indicate the name and endpoint of a cluster and will be used by external users in their containers' X-Container-Sync-To metadata header values with the format "realm_name/cluster_name/container_name". Realm and cluster names are considered case insensitive.
   * - ``cluster_clustername2`` = ``https://host2/v1/``
     - Any values in the realm section whose names begin with cluster\_ will indicate the name and endpoint of a cluster and will be used by external users in their containers' X-Container-Sync-To metadata header values with the format "realm_name/cluster_name/container_name". Realm and cluster names are considered case insensitive.
   * - ``key`` = ``realm1key``
     - The key is the overall cluster-to-cluster key used in combination with the external users' key that they set on their containers' X-Container-Sync-Key metadata header values. These keys will be used to sign each request the container sync daemon makes and used to validate each incoming container sync request.
   * - ``key2`` = ``realm1key2``
     - The key2 is optional and is an additional key incoming requests will be checked against. This is so you can rotate keys if you wish; you move the existing key to key2 and make a new key value.
