.. list-table:: Description of configuration options for ``[filter-proxy-logging]`` in ``object-expirer.conf``
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - ``access_log_address`` = ``/dev/log``
     - Location where syslog sends the logs to. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``access_log_facility`` = ``LOG_LOCAL0``
     - Syslog facility to receive log lines. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``access_log_headers`` = ``false``
     - Header to receive log lines. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``access_log_headers_only`` =
     - If access_log_headers is True and access_log_headers_only is set only these headers are logged. Multiple headers can be defined as comma separated list like this: access_log_headers_only = Host, X-Object-Meta-Mtime
   * - ``access_log_level`` = ``INFO``
     - Syslog logging level to receive log lines. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``access_log_name`` = ``swift``
     - Label used when logging. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``access_log_statsd_default_sample_rate`` = ``1.0``
     - Defines the probability of sending a sample for any given event or timing measurement. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``access_log_statsd_host`` = ``localhost``
     - You can use log_statsd_* from [DEFAULT], or override them here. StatsD server. IPv4/IPv6 addresses and hostnames are supported. If a hostname resolves to an IPv4 and IPv6 address, the IPv4 address will be used.
   * - ``access_log_statsd_metric_prefix`` =
     - Value will be prepended to every metric sent to the StatsD server. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``access_log_statsd_port`` = ``8125``
     - Port value for the StatsD server. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``access_log_statsd_sample_rate_factor`` = ``1.0``
     - Not recommended to set this to a value less than 1.0, if frequency of logging is too high, tune the log_statsd_default_sample_rate instead. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``access_log_udp_host`` =
     -  If not set, the UDP receiver for syslog is disabled. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``access_log_udp_port`` = ``514``
     - Port value for UDP receiver, if enabled. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``log_statsd_valid_http_methods`` = ``GET,HEAD,POST,PUT,DELETE,COPY,OPTIONS``
     - What HTTP methods are allowed for StatsD logging (comma-sep). request methods not in this list will have "BAD_METHOD" for the <verb> portion of the metric.
   * - ``reveal_sensitive_prefix`` = ``16``
     - By default, the X-Auth-Token is logged. To obscure the value, set reveal_sensitive_prefix to the number of characters to log. For example, if set to 12, only the first 12 characters of the token appear in the log. An unauthorized access of the log file won't allow unauthorized usage of the token. However, the first 12 or so characters is unique enough that you can trace/debug token usage. Set to 0 to suppress the token completely (replaced by '...' in the log).

       .. note:: reveal_sensitive_prefix will not affect the value logged with access_log_headers=True.
