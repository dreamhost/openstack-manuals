.. list-table:: Description of ML2 configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[ml2]**
     -
   * - ``extension_drivers`` =
     - (List) An ordered list of extension driver entrypoints to be loaded from the neutron.ml2.extension_drivers namespace. For example: extension_drivers = port_security,qos
   * - ``external_network_type`` = ``None``
     - (String) Default network type for external networks when no provider attributes are specified. By default it is None, which means that if provider attributes are not specified while creating external networks then they will have the same type as tenant networks. Allowed values for external_network_type config option depend on the network type values configured in type_drivers config option.
   * - ``mechanism_drivers`` =
     - (List) An ordered list of networking mechanism driver entrypoints to be loaded from the neutron.ml2.mechanism_drivers namespace.
   * - ``path_mtu`` = ``1500``
     - (Integer) Maximum size of an IP packet (MTU) that can traverse the underlying physical network infrastructure without fragmentation. For instances using a self-service/private network, neutron subtracts the overlay protocol overhead from this value and provides it to instances via DHCP option 26. For example, using a value of 9000, DHCP provides 8950 to instances using a VXLAN network that contains 50 bytes of overhead. Using a value of 0 disables this feature and instances typically default to a 1500 MTU. Only impacts instances, not neutron network components such as bridges and routers.
   * - ``physical_network_mtus`` =
     - (List) A list of mappings of physical networks to MTU values. The format of the mapping is <physnet>:<mtu val>. This mapping allows specifying a physical network MTU value that differs from the default segment_mtu value.
   * - ``tenant_network_types`` = ``local``
     - (List) Ordered list of network_types to allocate as tenant networks. The default value 'local' is useful for single-box testing but provides no connectivity between hosts.
   * - ``type_drivers`` = ``local, flat, vlan, gre, vxlan, geneve``
     - (List) List of network type driver entrypoints to be loaded from the neutron.ml2.type_drivers namespace.
