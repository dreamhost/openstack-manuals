   * - ``certfile`` = ``/etc/keystone/ssl/certs/keystone.pem``
     - (String) DEPRECATED: Path of the certfile for SSL. For non-production environments, you may be interested in using `keystone-manage ssl_setup` to generate self-signed certificates.
   * - ``enable`` = ``False``

   * - ``ca_certs`` = ``/etc/keystone/ssl/certs/ca.pem``
     - (String) DEPRECATED: Path of the CA for token signing. PKI token support has been deprecated in the M release and will be removed in the O release. Fernet or UUID tokens are recommended.

   * - ``certfile`` = ``/etc/keystone/ssl/certs/signing_cert.pem``
     - (String) DEPRECATED: Path of the certfile for token signing. For non-production environments, you may be interested in using `keystone-manage pki_setup` to generate self-signed certificates.

   * - ``key_size`` = ``2048``
     - (Integer) DEPRECATED: Key size (in bits) for token signing cert (auto generated certificate). PKI token support has been deprecated in the M release and will be removed in the O release. Fernet or UUID tokens are recommended.
