.. list-table:: Description of configuration options for ``[account-reaper]`` in ``account-server.conf``
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - ``concurrency`` = ``25``
     - Number of replication workers to spawn
   * - ``conn_timeout`` = ``0.5``
     - Connection timeout to external services
   * - ``delay_reaping`` = ``0``
     - Normally, the reaper begins deleting account information for deleted accounts immediately; you can set this to delay its work however. The value is in seconds, 2592000 = 30 days, for example. bind to giving up worker can process simultaneously (it will actually accept(2) N + 1). Setting this to one (1) will only handle one request at a time, without accepting another request concurrently. By increasing the number of workers to a much higher value, one can reduce the impact of slow file system operations in one request from negatively impacting other requests.
   * - ``interval`` = ``3600``
     - Minimum time for a pass to take
   * - ``log_address`` = ``/dev/log``
     - Location where syslog sends the logs to
   * - ``log_facility`` = ``LOG_LOCAL0``
     - Syslog log facility
   * - ``log_level`` = ``INFO``
     - Logging level
   * - ``log_name`` = ``account-reaper``
     - Label used when logging
   * - ``node_timeout`` = ``10``
     - Request timeout to external services
   * - ``reap_warn_after`` = ``2592000``
     - If the account fails to be reaped due to a persistent error, the account reaper will log a message such as:

       Account <name> has not been reaped since <date>

       You can search logs for this message if space is not being reclaimed after you delete account(s). This is in addition to any time requested by delay_reaping.
