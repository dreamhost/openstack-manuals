.. list-table:: Description of common configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[DEFAULT]**
     -
   * - ``batch_polled_samples`` = ``True``
     - (Boolean) To reduce polling agent load, samples are sent to the notification agent in a batch. To gain higher throughput at the cost of load set this to False.
   * - ``database_connection`` = ``None``
     - (String) DEPRECATED - Database connection string.
   * - ``event_connection`` = ``None``
     - (String) The connection string used to connect to the event database. (if unset, connection is used)
   * - ``event_time_to_live`` = ``-1``
     - (Integer) Number of seconds that events are kept in the database for (<= 0 means forever).
   * - ``executor_thread_pool_size`` = ``64``
     - (Integer) Size of executor thread pool.
   * - ``host`` = ``localhost``
     - (String) Name of this node, which must be valid in an AMQP key. Can be an opaque identifier. For ZeroMQ only, must be a valid host name, FQDN, or IP address.
   * - ``http_timeout`` = ``600``
     - (Integer) Timeout seconds for HTTP requests. Set it to None to disable timeout.
   * - ``memcached_servers`` = ``None``
     - (List) Memcached servers or None for in process cache.
   * - ``metering_connection`` = ``None``
     - (String) The connection string used to connect to the metering database. (if unset, connection is used)
   * - ``metering_time_to_live`` = ``-1``
     - (Integer) Number of seconds that samples are kept in the database for (<= 0 means forever).
   * - ``polling_namespaces`` = ``['compute', 'central']``
     - (Unknown) Polling namespace(s) to be used while resource polling
   * - ``pollster_list`` = ``[]``
     - (Unknown) List of pollsters (or wildcard templates) to be used while polling
   * - ``rootwrap_config`` = ``/etc/ceilometer/rootwrap.conf``
     - (String) Path to the rootwrap configuration file touse for running commands as root
   * - ``shuffle_time_before_polling_task`` = ``0``
     - (Integer) To reduce large requests at same time to Nova or other components from different compute agents, shuffle start time of polling task.
   * - ``sql_expire_samples_only`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Indicates if expirer expires only samples. If set true, expired samples will be deleted, but residual resource and meter definition data will remain.
   * - **[compute]**
     -
   * - ``resource_update_interval`` = ``0``
     - (Integer) New instances will be discovered periodically based on this option (in seconds). By default, the agent discovers instances according to pipeline polling interval. If option is greater than 0, the instance list to poll will be updated based on this option's interval. Measurements relating to the instances will match intervals defined in pipeline.
   * - ``workload_partitioning`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Enable work-load partitioning, allowing multiple compute agents to be run simultaneously.
   * - **[coordination]**
     -
   * - ``backend_url`` = ``None``
     - (String) The backend URL to use for distributed coordination. If left empty, per-deployment central agent and per-host compute agent won't do workload partitioning and will only function correctly if a single instance of that service is running.
   * - ``check_watchers`` = ``10.0``
     - (Floating point) Number of seconds between checks to see if group membership has changed
   * - ``heartbeat`` = ``1.0``
     - (Floating point) Number of seconds between heartbeats for distributed coordination.
   * - ``max_retry_interval`` = ``30``
     - (Integer) Maximum number of seconds between retry to join partitioning group
   * - ``retry_backoff`` = ``1``
     - (Integer) Retry backoff factor when retrying to connect withcoordination backend
   * - **[meter]**
     -
   * - ``meter_definitions_cfg_file`` = ``meters.yaml``
     - (String) Configuration file for defining meter notifications.
   * - **[polling]**
     -
   * - ``partitioning_group_prefix`` = ``None``
     - (String) Work-load partitioning group prefix. Use only if you want to run multiple polling agents with different config files. For each sub-group of the agent pool with the same partitioning_group_prefix a disjoint subset of pollsters should be loaded.
