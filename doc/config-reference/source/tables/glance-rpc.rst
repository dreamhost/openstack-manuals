   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description

     -
   * - ``allowed_rpc_exception_modules`` = ``glance.common.exception, builtins, exceptions``
     - (List) Modules of exceptions that are permitted to be recreated upon receiving exception data from an rpc call.
   * - ``rpc_backend`` = ``rabbit``
     - (String) The messaging driver to use, defaults to rabbit. Other drivers include amqp and zmq.
   * - ``rpc_cast_timeout`` = ``-1``
     - (Integer) Seconds to wait before a cast expires (TTL). The default value of -1 specifies an infinite linger period. The value of 0 specifies no linger period. Pending messages shall be discarded immediately when the socket is closed. Only supported by impl_zmq.
   * - ``rpc_conn_pool_size`` = ``30``
     - (Integer) Size of RPC connection pool.
   * - ``rpc_poll_timeout`` = ``1``
     - (Integer) The default number of seconds that poll should wait. Poll raises timeout exception when timeout expired.
   * - ``rpc_response_timeout`` = ``60``
     - (Integer) Seconds to wait for a response from a call.
   * - **[oslo_concurrency]**
     -
   * - ``disable_process_locking`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Enables or disables inter-process locks.
   * - ``lock_path`` = ``None``
     - (String) Directory to use for lock files. For security, the specified directory should only be writable by the user running the processes that need locking. Defaults to environment variable OSLO_LOCK_PATH. If external locks are used, a lock path must be set.
   * - **[oslo_messaging_amqp]**
     -
   * - ``allow_insecure_clients`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Accept clients using either SSL or plain TCP

     - (String) address prefix used when broadcasting to all servers
   * - ``container_name`` = ``None``
     - (String) Name for the AMQP container
   * - ``group_request_prefix`` = ``unicast``
     - (String) address prefix when sending to any server in group
   * - ``idle_timeout`` = ``0``
     - (Integer) Timeout for inactive connections (in seconds)
   * - ``password`` =
     - (String) Password for message broker authentication
   * - ``sasl_config_dir`` =
     - (String) Path to directory that contains the SASL configuration
   * - ``sasl_config_name`` =
     - (String) Name of configuration file (without .conf suffix)
   * - ``sasl_mechanisms`` =
     - (String) Space separated list of acceptable SASL mechanisms
   * - ``server_request_prefix`` = ``exclusive``
     - (String) address prefix used when sending to a specific server
   * - ``ssl_ca_file`` =
     - (String) CA certificate PEM file to verify server certificate
   * - ``ssl_cert_file`` =
     - (String) Identifying certificate PEM file to present to clients

     - (String) Private key PEM file used to sign cert_file certificate
   * - ``ssl_key_password`` = ``None``
     - (String) Password for decrypting ssl_key_file (if encrypted)
   * - ``trace`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Debug: dump AMQP frames to stdout
   * - ``username`` =
     - (String) User name for message broker authentication

     - (String) Exchange name for receiving RPC replies
   * - ``rpc_reply_listener_prefetch_count`` = ``100``
     - (Integer) Max number of not acknowledged message which RabbitMQ can send to rpc reply listener.
   * - ``rpc_reply_retry_attempts`` = ``-1``
     - (Integer) Reconnecting retry count in case of connectivity problem during sending reply. -1 means infinite retry during rpc_timeout

   * - ``rpc_retry_delay`` = ``0.25``
     - (Floating point) Reconnecting retry delay in case of connectivity problem during sending RPC message
   * - ``socket_timeout`` = ``0.25``
     - (Floating point) Set socket timeout in seconds for connection's socket
