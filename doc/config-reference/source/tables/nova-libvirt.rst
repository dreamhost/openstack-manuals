   * - ``cpu_model`` = ``None``

   * - ``hw_machine_type`` = ``None``
     - (List) For qemu or KVM guests, set this option to specify a default machine type per host architecture. You can find a list of supported machine types in your environment by checking the output of the "virsh capabilities"command. The format of the value for this config option is host-arch=machine-type. For example: x86_64=machinetype1,armv7l=machinetype2

     - (String) The RADOS pool in which rbd volumes are stored
   * - ``images_type`` = ``default``
     - (String) VM Images format. If default is specified, then use_cow_images flag is used instead of this one.
   * - ``images_volume_group`` = ``None``
     - (String) LVM Volume Group that is used for VM images, when you specify images_type=lvm.
   * - ``inject_key`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Inject the ssh public key at boot time
   * - ``inject_partition`` = ``-2``
     - (Integer) The partition to inject to : -2 => disable, -1 => inspect (libguestfs only), 0 => not partitioned, >0 => partition number
   * - ``inject_password`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Inject the admin password at boot time, without an agent.
   * - ``iscsi_iface`` = ``None``
     - (String) The iSCSI transport iface to use to connect to target in case offload support is desired. Default format is of the form <transport_name>.<hwaddress> where <transport_name> is one of (be2iscsi, bnx2i, cxgb3i, cxgb4i, qla4xxx, ocs) and <hwaddress> is the MAC address of the interface and can be generated via the iscsiadm -m iface command. Do not confuse the iscsi_iface parameter to be provided here with the actual transport name.
   * - ``iscsi_use_multipath`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Use multipath connection of the iSCSI or FC volume

   * - ``remove_unused_kernels`` = ``True``
     - (Boolean) DEPRECATED: Should unused kernel images be removed? This is only safe to enable if all compute nodes have been updated to support this option (running Grizzly or newer level compute). This will be the default behavior in the 13.0.0 release.
