.. list-table:: Description of configuration options for ``[filter-proxy-logging]`` in ``proxy-server.conf``
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - ``access_log_address`` = ``/dev/log``
     - Location where syslog sends the logs to. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``access_log_facility`` = ``LOG_LOCAL0``
     - Syslog facility to receive log lines. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``access_log_headers`` = ``false``
     - Header to receive log lines. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``access_log_headers_only`` =
     - If access_log_headers is True and access_log_headers_only is set only these headers are logged. Multiple headers can be defined as comma separated list like this: access_log_headers_only = Host, X-Object-Meta-Mtime.
   * - ``access_log_level`` = ``INFO``
     - Syslog logging level to receive log lines. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``access_log_name`` = ``swift``
     - Label used when logging. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``access_log_statsd_default_sample_rate`` = ``1.0``
     - Defines the probability of sending a sample for any given event or timing measurement. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``access_log_statsd_host`` = ``localhost``
     - You can use log_statsd_* from [DEFAULT], or override them here. StatsD server. IPv4/IPv6 addresses and hostnames are supported. If a hostname resolves to an IPv4 and IPv6 address, the IPv4 address will be used.
   * - ``access_log_statsd_metric_prefix`` =
     - Value will be prepended to every metric sent to the StatsD server. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``access_log_statsd_port`` = ``8125``
     - Port value for the StatsD server. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``access_log_statsd_sample_rate_factor`` = ``1.0``
     - Not recommended to set this to a value less than 1.0, if frequency of logging is too high, tune the log_statsd_default_sample_rate instead. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``access_log_udp_host`` =
     -  If not set, the UDP receiver for syslog is disabled. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``access_log_udp_port`` = ``514``
     - Port value for UDP receiver, if enabled. If not set, logging directives from [DEFAULT] without "access\_" will be used.
   * - ``log_statsd_valid_http_methods`` = ``GET,HEAD,POST,PUT,DELETE,COPY,OPTIONS``
     - What HTTP methods are allowed for StatsD logging (comma-sep). request methods not in this list will have "BAD_METHOD" for the <verb> portion of the metric.
   * - ``reveal_sensitive_prefix`` = ``16``
     - The X-Auth-Token is sensitive data. If revealed to an unauthorised person, they can now make requests against an account until the token expires. Set reveal_sensitive_prefix to the number of characters of the token that are logged. For example reveal_sensitive_prefix = 12 so only first 12 characters of the token are logged. Or, set to 0 to completely remove the token.

       .. note:: reveal_sensitive_prefix will not affect the value logged with access_log_headers=True.
   * - ``use`` = ``egg:swift#proxy_logging``
     - Entry point of paste.deploy in the server.
