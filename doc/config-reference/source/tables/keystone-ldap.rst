   * - ``tls_req_cert`` = ``demand``
     - (String) Specifies what checks to perform on client certificates in an incoming TLS session.
   * - ``url`` = ``ldap://localhost``

     - (String) LDAP attribute mapped to user enabled flag.
   * - ``user_enabled_default`` = ``True``
     - (String) Default value to enable users. This should match an appropriate int value if the LDAP server uses non-boolean (bitmask) values to indicate if a user is enabled or disabled.

   * - ``user_enabled_emulation`` = ``False``

   * - ``user_enabled_emulation_use_group_config`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Use the "group_member_attribute" and "group_objectclass" settings to determine membership in the emulated enabled group.
   * - ``user_enabled_invert`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Invert the meaning of the boolean enabled values. Some LDAP servers use a boolean lock attribute where "true" means an account is disabled. Setting "user_enabled_invert = true" will allow these lock attributes to be used. This setting will have no effect if "user_enabled_mask" or "user_enabled_emulation" settings are in use.
   * - ``user_enabled_mask`` = ``0``
     - (Integer) Bitmask integer to indicate the bit that the enabled value is stored in if the LDAP server represents "enabled" as a bit on an integer rather than a boolean. A value of "0" indicates the mask is not used. If this is not set to "0" the typical value is "2". This is typically used when "user_enabled_attribute = userAccountControl".
   * - ``user_filter`` = ``None``
     - (String) LDAP search filter for users.
