.. list-table:: Description of Fernet tokens configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[fernet_tokens]**
     -
   * - ``key_repository`` = ``/etc/keystone/fernet-keys/``
     - (String) Directory containing Fernet token keys.
   * - ``max_active_keys`` = ``3``
     - (Integer) This controls how many keys are held in rotation by keystone-manage fernet_rotate before they are discarded. The default value of 3 means that keystone will maintain one staged key, one primary key, and one secondary key. Increasing this value means that additional secondary keys will be kept in the rotation.
