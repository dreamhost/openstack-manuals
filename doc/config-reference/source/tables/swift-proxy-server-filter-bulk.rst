.. list-table:: Description of configuration options for ``[filter-bulk]`` in ``proxy-server.conf``
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - ``delete_container_retry_count`` = ``0``
     - The parameter is used during a bulk delete of objects and their container. This would frequently fail because it is very likely that all replicated objects have not been deleted by the time the middleware got a successful response. It can be configured the number of retries. And the number of seconds to wait between each retry will be 1.5**retry.
   * - ``max_containers_per_extraction`` = ``10000``
     - The maximum numbers of containers per extraction.
   * - ``max_deletes_per_request`` = ``10000``
     - The maximum numbers of deletion per request.
   * - ``max_failed_deletes`` = ``1000``
     - The maximum number of tries to delete before failure.
   * - ``max_failed_extractions`` = ``1000``
     - The maximum number of tries to extract before failure.
   * - ``use`` = ``egg:swift#bulk``
     - Entry point of paste.deploy in the server.
   * - ``yield_frequency`` = ``10``
     - In order to keep a connection active during a potentially long bulk request, Swift may return whitespace prepended to the actual response body. This whitespace will be yielded no more than every yield_frequency seconds.
