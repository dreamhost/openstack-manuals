   * - ``batch_size`` = ``1``
     - (Integer) Number of notification messages to wait before publishing them
   * - ``batch_timeout`` = ``None``
     - (Integer) Number of seconds to wait before publishing sampleswhen batch_size is not reached (None means indefinitely)
   * - ``disable_non_metric_meters`` = ``True``
     - (Boolean) WARNING: Ceilometer historically offered the ability to store events as meters. This usage is NOT advised as it can flood the metering database and cause performance degradation.
