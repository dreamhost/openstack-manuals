Setting this to one (1) will only handle one request at a time, without accepting another request concurrently. By increasing the number of workers to a much higher value, one can reduce the impact of slow file system operations in one request from negatively impacting other requests. underlying filesystem does not support it. to setup custom log handlers. bytes you'd like fallocate to reserve, whether there is space for the given file size or not. This is useful for systems that behave badly when they completely run out of space; you can make the services pretend they're out of space early. container server. For most cases, this should be
