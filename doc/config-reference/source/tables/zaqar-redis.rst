.. list-table:: Description of Redis configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[drivers:management_store:redis]**
     -
   * - ``max_reconnect_attempts`` = ``10``
     - (Integer) Maximum number of times to retry an operation that failed due to a redis node failover.
   * - ``reconnect_sleep`` = ``1.0``
     - (Floating point) Base sleep interval between attempts to reconnect after a redis node failover.
   * - ``uri`` = ``redis://127.0.0.1:6379``
     - (String) Redis connection URI, taking one of three forms. For a direct connection to a Redis server, use the form "redis://host[:port][?options]", where port defaults to 6379 if not specified. For an HA master-slave Redis cluster using Redis Sentinel, use the form "redis://host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...,hostN[:portN]][?options]", where each host specified corresponds to an instance of redis-sentinel. In this form, the name of the Redis master used in the Sentinel configuration must be included in the query string as "master=<name>". Finally, to connect to a local instance of Redis over a unix socket, you may use the form "redis:/path/to/redis.sock[?options]". In all forms, the "socket_timeout" option may be specified in the query string. Its value is given in seconds. If not provided, "socket_timeout" defaults to 0.1 seconds.
