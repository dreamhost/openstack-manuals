.. list-table:: Description of HyperV configuration options
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - **[hyperv]**
     -
   * - ``dynamic_memory_ratio`` = ``1.0``
     - (Floating point) Dynamic memory ratio Enables dynamic memory allocation (ballooning) when set to a value greater than 1. The value expresses the ratio between the total RAM assigned to an instance and its startup RAM amount. For example a ratio of 2.0 for an instance with 1024MB of RAM implies 512MB of RAM allocated at startup. Possible values: * 1.0: Disables dynamic memory allocation (Default). * Float values greater than 1.0: Enables allocation of total implied RAM divided by this value for startup. Services which consume this: * nova-compute Related options: * None
   * - ``enable_instance_metrics_collection`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Enable instance metrics collection Enables metrics collections for an instance by using Hyper-V's metric APIs. Collected data can by retrieved by other apps and services, e.g.: Ceilometer. Possible values: * True: Enables metrics collection. * False: Disables metric collection (Default). Services which consume this: * nova-compute Related options: * None
   * - ``instances_path_share`` =
     - (String) Instances path share The name of a Windows share mapped to the "instances_path" dir and used by the resize feature to copy files to the target host. If left blank, an administrative share (hidden network share) will be used, looking for the same "instances_path" used locally. Possible values: * "": An administrative share will be used (Default). * Name of a Windows share. Services which consume this: * nova-compute Related options: * "instances_path": The directory which will be used if this option here is left blank.
   * - ``limit_cpu_features`` = ``False``
     - (Boolean) Limit CPU features This flag is needed to support live migration to hosts with different CPU features and checked during instance creation in order to limit the CPU features used by the instance. Possible values: * True: Limit processor-specific features. * False: Do not limit processor-specific features (Default). Services which consume this: * nova-compute Related options: * None
   * - ``mounted_disk_query_retry_count`` = ``10``
     - (Integer) The number of times to retry checking for a disk mounted via iSCSI.
   * - ``mounted_disk_query_retry_interval`` = ``5``
     - (Integer) Interval between checks for a mounted iSCSI disk, in seconds.
   * - ``power_state_check_timeframe`` = ``60``
     - (Integer) The timeframe to be checked for instance power state changes.
   * - ``power_state_event_polling_interval`` = ``2``
     - (Integer) Instance power state change event polling frequency.
   * - ``qemu_img_cmd`` = ``qemu-img.exe``
     - (String) Path of qemu-img command which is used to convert between different image types
   * - ``vswitch_name`` = ``None``
     - (String) External virtual switch Name, if not provided, the first external virtual switch is used
   * - ``wait_soft_reboot_seconds`` = ``60``
     - (Integer) Number of seconds to wait for instance to shut down after soft reboot request is made. We fall back to hard reboot if instance does not shutdown within this window.
