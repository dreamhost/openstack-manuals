.. list-table:: Description of configuration options for ``[object-replicator]`` in ``object-server.conf``
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: config-ref-table

   * - Configuration option = Default value
     - Description
   * - ``concurrency`` = ``1``
     - Number of replication workers to spawn
   * - ``daemonize`` = ``on``
     - Whether or not to run replication as a daemon
   * - ``handoff_delete`` = ``auto``
     - By default handoff partitions will be removed when it has successfully replicated to all the canonical nodes. If set to an integer n, it will remove the partition if it is successfully replicated to n nodes. The default setting should not be changed, except for extremem situations. This uses what's set here, or what's set in the DEFAULT section, or 10 (though other sections use 3 as the final default).
   * - ``handoffs_first`` = ``False``
     - If set to True, partitions that are not supposed to be on the node will be replicated first. The default setting should not be changed, except for extreme situations.
   * - ``http_timeout`` = ``60``
     - Maximum duration for an HTTP request
   * - ``interval`` = ``30``
     - Minimum time for a pass to take
   * - ``lockup_timeout`` = ``1800``
     - Attempts to kill all workers if nothing replications for lockup_timeout seconds
   * - ``log_address`` = ``/dev/log``
     - Location where syslog sends the logs to
   * - ``log_facility`` = ``LOG_LOCAL0``
     - Syslog log facility
   * - ``log_level`` = ``INFO``
     - Logging level
   * - ``log_name`` = ``object-replicator``
     - Label used when logging
   * - ``node_timeout`` = ``<whatever's in the DEFAULT section or 10>``
     - Request timeout to external services
   * - ``reclaim_age`` = ``604800``
     - Time elapsed in seconds before an object can be reclaimed
   * - ``recon_cache_path`` = ``/var/cache/swift``
     - Directory where stats for a few items will be stored
   * - ``ring_check_interval`` = ``15``
     - How often (in seconds) to check the ring
   * - ``rsync_bwlimit`` = ``0``
     - bandwidth limit for rsync in kB/s. 0 means unlimited
   * - ``rsync_compress`` = ``no``
     - Allows rsync to compress data which is transmitted to the destination node during sync. However, this applies only when the destination node is in a different region than the local one.

       .. note:: Objects that are already compressed (for example: .tar.gz, .mp3) might slow down the syncing process.
   * - ``rsync_error_log_line_length`` = ``0``
     - Limits the length of the rsync error log lines. 0 will log the entire line.
   * - ``rsync_io_timeout`` = ``30``
     - Passed to rsync for a max duration (seconds) of an I/O op
   * - ``rsync_module`` = ``{replication_ip}::object``
     - Format of the rsync module where the replicator will send data. The configuration value can include some variables that will be extracted from the ring. Variables must follow the format {NAME} where NAME is one of: ip, port, replication_ip, replication_port, region, zone, device, meta. See etc/rsyncd.conf-sample for some examples. uses what's set here, or what's set in the DEFAULT section, or 10 (though other sections use 3 as the final default).
   * - ``rsync_timeout`` = ``900``
     - Max duration (seconds) of a partition rsync
   * - ``run_pause`` = ``30``
     - Time in seconds to wait between replication passes
   * - ``stats_interval`` = ``300``
     - Interval in seconds between logging replication statistics
   * - ``sync_method`` = ``rsync``
     - default is rsync, alternative is ssync
