Building
========

Various manuals are in subdirectories of the ``doc/`` directory.

Guides
------

All guides are in the RST format. You can use tox to prepare
virtual environment and build all guides::

    tox -e docs

You can also build a specific guide.

For example, to build *OpenStack End User Guide*, use the following command::

    tox -e build -- user-guide

You can find the root of the generated HTML documentation at::

    doc/user-guide/build/html/index.html


Testing of changes and building of the manual
=============================================

Install the Python tox package and run ``tox`` from the top-level
directory to use the same tests that are done as part of our Jenkins
gating jobs.

If you like to run individual tests, run:

 * ``tox -e linkcheck`` - to run the tests for working remote URLs
 * ``tox -e checkniceness`` - to run the niceness tests
 * ``tox -e checkbuild`` - to actually build the manual
 * ``tox -e checklang`` - to build translated manuals

tox will use the openstack-doc-tools package for execution of these
tests.
