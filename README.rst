Building
========
Various manuals are in subdirectories of the ``doc/`` directory.

Guides
------
Various guides are in the RST format. You can use tox to prepare
virtual environment and build all RST based guides::

    tox -e docs

You can also build a specific guide.
For example, to build *OpenStack End User Guide*, use the following command::

    tox -e build -- user-guide

You can find the root of the generated HTML documentation at::

    doc/user-guide/build/html/index.html

Glossary
--------

`Apache Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>`_ must be installed to build the
glossary.

To install Maven 3 for Ubuntu 12.04 and later, and Debian wheezy and later::

    apt-get install maven

On Fedora 20 and later::

    yum install maven

On openSUSE 13.1 and later::

    zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/tools:/building/openSUSE_13.1/devel:tools:building.repo
    zypper install maven

To build the glossary, move to ``doc/glossary``,
then run the ``mvn`` command in that directory::

    cd doc/glossary
    mvn clean generate-sources

The generated PDF documentation file is::

    doc/glossary/target/docbkx/webhelp/glossary/glossary.pdf

The root of the generated HTML documentation is::

    doc/glossary/target/docbkx/webhelp/glossary/content/index.html


Testing of changes and building of the manual
=============================================

Install the python tox package and run ``tox`` from the top-level
directory to use the same tests that are done as part of our Jenkins
gating jobs.

If you like to run individual tests, run:

 * ``tox -e checklinks`` - to run the tests for working remote URLs
 * ``tox -e checkniceness`` - to run the niceness tests
 * ``tox -e checksyntax`` - to run syntax checks
 * ``tox -e checkdeletions`` - to check that no deleted files are referenced
 * ``tox -e checkbuild`` - to actually build the manual
 * ``tox -e checklang`` - to build translated manuals

tox will use the openstack-doc-tools package for execution of these
tests.
